# Inventory-Level-Alert
This Python code checks an inventory for items with zero stock (or specified quantity limit) and sends an email notification using Outlook if any such items are found.
It compiles a list of out-of-stock items and emails this list to a specified address, notifying the recipient to reorder those items.
If all items are in stock, it prints a message indicating so.
